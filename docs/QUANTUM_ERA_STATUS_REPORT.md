## ⚠️ Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks
1. **Performance Target Risk** (300% improvement)
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on highest-impact functions first
   - **Contingency**: Accept 200% as minimum viable improvement

2. **Team Adoption Risk** (Minimal context patterns)
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training and immediate benefit demonstration
   - **Contingency**: Gradual adoption with champion developer approach

3. **Technical Integration Risk** (Quantum-resistant security)
   - **Mitigation**: Implement alongside existing systems, not replacement
   - **Contingency**: Phase integration over 2 weeks instead of 1

### Medium-Priority Risks
- Context reduction impacts functionality
- Timeline compression affects quality
- Resource allocation conflicts
